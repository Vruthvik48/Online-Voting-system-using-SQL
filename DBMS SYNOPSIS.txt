ABSTRACT :

A “E–VOTING  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is to revolutionize the electoral  process by leveraging technology to enhance accessibility efficiency and transparency. By allowing voters to cast their ballots remotely from any location with an internet connection, online voting systems break down barriers to participation and empower individuals who may face obstacles in physically accessing polling stations. This convenience not only encourages higher voter turnout but also reduces the logistical challenges associated with traditional voting methods, such as long lines and wait times. Additionally, online voting systems offer greater accuracy through automated counting processes, minimizing errors and ensuring the integrity of election results. Furthermore, these systems promote transparency by providing  real-time tracking of votes and   implementing robust security measures to safeguard against fraud and manipulation.

Overall, the purpose of E-Voting Management Systems is to modernize democracy,
making it more inclusive, efficient, and trustworthy for all citizens.
